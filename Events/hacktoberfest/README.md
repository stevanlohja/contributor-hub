Hacktoberfest is a global open-source event held every October, where developers contribute pull requests to public repositories to earn digital rewards.
Midnight is joining the celebration by inviting contributors to improve its open-source ecosystem — from smart contracts and DApps to core libraries and documentation.

Review the guide to get started.

1. Registration
To participate, register at https://hacktoberfest.com/auth/.

All opportunities to contribute to Midnight’s open source ecosystem will be available through our Community Hub.

Participants are encouraged to submit six (6) high-quality pull or merge requests between October 1 and October 31 to earn the official Hacktoberfest digital badge.
Review our Contribution Guidelines before submitting any work.

2. Hacktoberfest Participation
Look for issues labeled hacktoberfest to find eligible contribution opportunities.

Docs: Submit pull requests to the Midnight Docs repository.
Core Libraries: Submit issues or PRs to MidnightJs.
No-code / Low-code: Create an issue in the Community Hub using one of the following templates, assign it to yourself, and post a link to your work in the issue comments:
dapp-proposal

documentation improvement
Once reviewed and approved, qualifying issues will be labeled hacktoberfest-accepted.

To earn additional Midnight-specific rewards, visit our Zealy quests and complete the tasks under the Hacktoberfest Sprint.
