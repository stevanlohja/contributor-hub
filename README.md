  2. Open the folder for your event (e.g. `events/hacktoberfest-2025/`).  
  3. Inside, create a new Markdown file named after your handle or team: events/<event-slug>/<your-handle-or-team-slug>.md
  4. Copy and fill out the [submission template](./events/README.md). It works for projects, tutorials, threads, or any other type of contribution.  
  5. Commit and open a Pull Request.

  Once your PR is merged, your submission will appear in the eventâ€™s showcase page automatically.
