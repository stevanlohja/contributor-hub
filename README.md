# 👥 Contributor Hub

The **Contributor Hub** is the central collaborative platform for gathering and managing community-driven contributions within the `midnightntwrk` organization. It serves as the primary entry point for proposing new content, requesting features, reporting issues, or ideating for dApps on the Midnight Network.

## 🛠 How to Contribute

We welcome contributions of all types, including code, documentation, and technical content.

### Submitting Issues
Use our GitHub Issue Forms to submit:
* **Bug Reports:** Provide detailed information including steps to reproduce and expected behavior. Note: if a bug pertains to a specific repo (like `midnight-js`), report it there directly.
* **Feature Requests:** Clearly describe the proposed feature, its benefits, and the expected outcome.
* **Content Proposals:** Propose new tutorials, blog posts, or documentation improvements.

### Pull Request Process
1.  **Fork the Repo:** Create your own fork of the repository.
2.  **Create a Branch:** Use a descriptive name prefixed with a short moniker (e.g., `jill-my-feature`).
3.  **Follow Standards:** Adhere to the coding style guides and ensure new functionality includes unit and integration tests.
4.  **License Header:** Ensure all new files include the Apache-2.0 license header.
5.  **Submit:** Open a PR to the main repository. Avoid `--force` pushes to assist the review process.

## 📅 Events & Showcases

If you are participating in a Midnight event (such as **Hacktoberfest** or the **Midnight Summit**), you can showcase your work here:
1.  Navigate to the `/events` folder.
2.  Create a Markdown file in the specific event sub-folder (e.g., `events/hacktoberfest-2025/your-handle.md`).
3.  Fill out the submission template found in the `events/README.md`.
