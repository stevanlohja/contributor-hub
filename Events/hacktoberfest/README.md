**Hacktoberfest** is a global open-source event held every October, where developers contribute pull requests to public repositories to earn digital rewards.

Midnight is joining the celebration by inviting contributors to improve its open-source ecosystem — from smart contracts and DApps to core libraries and documentation.

Review the guide to get started.

## 1. Registration

To participate, register at https://hacktoberfest.com/auth/.

All opportunities to contribute to Midnight’s open source ecosystem will be available through our [Community Hub](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/community-hub).

Participants are encouraged to submit six (6) high-quality pull or merge requests between *October 1 and October 31* to earn the official Hacktoberfest digital badge.
Review our [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/community-hub/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting any work.

## 2. Hacktoberfest Participation

Look for issues labeled hacktoberfest or browse through issues submitted by other community members to find contribution opportunities.

Docs: Submit pull requests to the [Midnight Docs repository](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/midnight-docs).
Core Libraries: Submit pull requests to [MidnightJs](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/midnight-js).
No-code / Low-code: Create pull requests in the [Community Hub](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/community-hub) using the submission template.

Once reviewed and approved, qualifying issues will be labeled `hacktoberfest-accepted`.
